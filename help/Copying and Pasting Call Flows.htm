   Copying and Pasting Call Flows</H1>
  <P>
   You have several choices at the call flow level on the Business 
   Entity Summary page. You can copy call flows and paste call flows.</P>
  <P>
   Whether you want to copy call flows and paste call flows depends on 
   how you want to use the call flow. If you plan on making changes to 
   the call flow, you may want to use a <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">copied 
   call flow</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A copied call flow is a 
   duplicate of a call flow in a database. It is not shared by other 
   call flows.)</DFN>.</P>
  <P>
   Copying call flows allows you greater flexibility because you are 
   using duplicates of call flows. This allows you to modify the copy of 
   the call flow to suit your needs.</P>
  <P>
   Therefore you should copy a call flow if you know of another call 
   flow that has most of the same informational requirements. For 
   example, if you need a Worker's Compensation call flow for AIG you 
   might want to copy the Gallagher Bassett Worker's Compensation call 
   flow and change it to exactly meet your informational needs.</P>
  <P>
   Once the call flow is copied you'll want to<SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot"> 
   paste call flow</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A pasted call flow is 
   a call flow moved from the Windows Clipboard to its new location)</DFN>.
    After you have pasted the call flow you edit the call.</P>
