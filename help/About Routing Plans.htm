   About Routing Plans</H1>
  <P>
   Routing Plans deliver claim information. Call Flows collect claim information.</P>
  <P>
   The call representative uses call flows to obtain claim information 
   from the caller. The <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">call flow</CITE></SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed"> 
   (A call flow is a group of screens that collect or lookup data as the 
   call representative is taking the call.)</DFN> requests claim 
   information required to complete a particular type of call. It is 
   specific to a line of business. For example the &quot;Workers 
   Compensation&quot; call flow requests information required to 
   correctly file a &quot;Worker's Compensation Claim.&quot; The 
   &quot;Commercial Liability&quot; call flow requests information 
   required to correctly file a &quot;Commercial Liability&quot; claim.</P>
  <P>
   Routing Plans are used to deliver claim information collected by call 
   representatives. FNSNet places the claim information into a First 
   Report of Injury claim form. This First Report Of Injury claim form 
   is sent to <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">destinations</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A
    Destination is a place or person such as risk location, branch or caller.)</DFN> 
   by various <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">methods</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A
    call can be mailed, faxed or emailed.)</DFN>.</P>
  <P>
   A <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">Routing Plan</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A
    Routing Plan has three parts: the type of transmission, destination 
   and items sent.)</DFN> is a plan for getting the claim to its destination.</P>
  <P>
   A Routing Plan uses how, when and why information to get the claim to 
   its destination. The <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">type of transmission</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(Transmission
    Type is the type of transmission such as a fax, print, email, EDI, etc.)</DFN> 
   is the how information describing what way the information is sent. 
   The <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">destination address</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(Destination
    Address is the address of the destination such as fax number, a 
   printer location or an email address.)</DFN> is the where information 
   telling to what place the information is sent. The <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">output
    </CITE></SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(Output is the items sent such as 
   cover letter, first report of injury and overflow.)</DFN> is the what 
   information describing what is sent.</P>

   Routing Plans are typically created in groups of 54. There is one 
   routing plan for each line of business (auto, liability, and 
   property) and one for every state and district of Columbia.</P>
