   When A New Routing Plan Is Needed</H1>
  <P>
   You have three choices for routing plans. You can use a flag within 
   the hierarchy, use an exiting routing plan or create a new routing plan.</P>
  <H4>
   Flag Within Hierarchy</H4>
  <P>
   You can use specific destination or additional delivery flags. These 
   allow you to add a distribution without using a routing plan. As a 
   result they are done live in production without the need to QA.</P>
  <P>
   Specific destinations and additional deliveries are all-or-nothing 
   distributions tied to a particular node within the hierarchy. If that 
   node is selected, they will in all cases be generated. If the 
   creation of a distribution needs to be conditional (by LOB, by state, 
   etc.), then a routing plan must be used. Routing plans allow for the 
   attachment of conditional logic by means of rules.</P>
  <H4>
   Existing Routing Plan</H4>
  <P>
   The best way to do a routing plan is use an existing routing plan. 
   Ninety percent of the time there is an existing routing plan that 
   will fit your needs. You use this option if you can use the existing 
   routing plan as is, with only small modifications.</P>
  <H4>
   New Routing Plan</H4>
  <P>
   Although it is rarely used, you do have the option of creating a <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">new
    routing plan</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A new routing plan is an 
   original routing plan added to the routing plan table.)</DFN>. 
   Typically, routing plans are created in groups of 54. New routing 
   plans are created for new types of transmission (a fax to a 
   physician, for example) and for specific destination that require 
   business logic (a fax for Bill Smith, but only for WOR).</P>
