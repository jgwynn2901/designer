   Account Call Flows</H1>
  <P>
   A call flow is a group of screens that collect or lookup data as you 
   are taking the call. The call flow requests the claim information 
   required to compete a particular type of call. It is specific to a 
   line of business and is unique for each client. An account call flow 
   is a call flow for a particular account.</P>
  <P>
   For example the &quot;Workers Compensation&quot; call flow requests 
   information required to correctly file a &quot;Worker's Compensation 
   Claim.&quot; The &quot;Commercial Liability&quot; call flow requests 
   information required to correctly file a &quot;Commercial 
   Liability&quot; claim.</P>
  <P>
   You can create a new call flow or edit a call flow. You can also copy 
   a call flow to the clipboard and paste the call flow from the 
   clipboard into another Business Entity Summary page. Filter Call Flow 
   enables you to create a custom list of call flows. In addition, you 
   can a call flow, attach a call flow to a client, risk location or 
   account. Refresh Call flow enables you to update the call flow with 
   the latest information.</P>
  <P>
   You use frames, attributes and rules to create a call flow. The Call 
   Flow Editor is a visual editor you use to create the frames, 
   attributes and rules that make a call flow.</P>
