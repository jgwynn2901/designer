   Sharing Call Flow Components</H1>
  <P>
   You can share call flow components such as frames, attributes or 
   rules. If you plan to use shared call flow components use the shared 
   components as is.</P>
  <P>
   Sharing call flow components has an important consequence because you 
   using an existing component. For example if you are sharing a call 
   flow component such as a frame you are using a frame in the frame 
   table. If you make changes to this shared frame you are changing the 
   frame. The changes will effect call flows that use those frames.</P>
  <P>
   You <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">attach call flow components</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(An
    attached call flow component such as a frame is a component joined 
   to a component in a database. It is also attached to a call flow.)</DFN> 
   to share call flow components. If you change your mind you can also <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">detach
    call flow components</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A detached call 
   flow component such as a frame is a component not joined to a 
   component in a database. It is also not attached the call flow.)</DFN>.</P>
  <P>
   The Designer has two icons concerning shared call flow components.</P>
  <P>
   The Shared Count icon <IMG SRC="sharedcountcallfcomponent.gif" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="14" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   tells you how many times the component is attached. The number to the 
   right of the Shared Count icon is the shared count. For example, <IMG SRC="sharedcountcallfcomponent.gif" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="14" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   tells you nine other call flows are sharing this call flow component. 
   You can also click the Shared Count icon to see a Reference Count 
   Report to see more detailed information on the references. The Shared 
   Count icon appears on the Call Flow Frame Name bar on the Call Flow Editor.</P>
  <P>
   The Status Report icon <IMG SRC="statuscallfcomponent.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="12" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   gives you a warning if the shared count is greater than one for call 
   flow component. For example, <IMG SRC="statuscallfcomponent.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="12" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   tells you more than one call flow is sharing this call flow 
   component. You can also click the Status Report icon to see a Status 
   Report to see more detailed information on the warnings. The Status 
   Report icon appears on the Frame Name bar on the Call Flow Editor.</P>
