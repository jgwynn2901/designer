   Sharing Call Flows</H1>
  <P>
   If you plan to use the call flow as is, you may want to use a <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">shared
    call flow</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A shared call flow is an 
   existing call flow in the call flow table.)</DFN>. </P>
  <P>
   Sharing call flows has an important consequences. When you share a 
   call flow you are sharing the frames from the frame table that make 
   up the call flow. Therefore if you change these shared frames the 
   changes will effect all call flows that use those frames.</P>
  <P>
   The call flows themselves are not directly shared. Each call flow has 
   a unique call flow ID.</P>
  <P>
   You <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">attach call flows</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(An
    attached call flow is a call flow joined to a client in the 
   database. It may also be attached to other clients.)</DFN> to share 
   call flows. If you change your mind you can also <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">detach
    call flows</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A detached call flow is a 
   call flow not joined to a client in a database.)</DFN>.</P>
  <P>
   The Designer has two icons concerning shared call flows.</P>
  <P>
   The Shared Count icon <IMG SRC="sharedcountcallflow2.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="15" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   tells you how many times its attached. The number to the right of the 
   Shared Count icon is the shared count. For example, <IMG SRC="sharedcountcallflow2.gif" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="15" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   tells you three other clients\Account Hierarchy Step IDs are sharing 
   this call flow. You can also click the Shared Count icon to see a 
   Reference Count Report to see more detailed information on the 
   references. The Shared Count icon appears on the Call Flow Name bar 
   on the Call Flow Editor.</P>
  <P>
   The Status Report icon <IMG SRC="statuscallflow.gif" WIDTH="249" HEIGHT="14" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   gives you a warning if the shared count is greater than one for the 
   call flow. For example, <IMG SRC="statuscallflow.gif" WIDTH="249" HEIGHT="14" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   tells you more than one Account Hierarchy Step ID is sharing this 
   call flow. You can also click the Status Report icon to see a Status 
   Report to see more detailed information on the warnings. The Status 
   Report icon appears on the Call Flow Name bar on the Call Flow Editor.</P>
