   Creating Call Flow Components</H1>
  <P>
   You can create call flow components such as frames, attributes or 
   rules. If you plan on making changes to the call flow components, you 
   may want to <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">create call flow components</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A
    created call flow component such as a frame is a new component added 
   to a component table.)</DFN>.</P>
  <P>
   Creating call flow components allows you greater flexibility because 
   you are making a new call flow component. For example, if you are 
   creating a call flow component such as a frame you are making a new frame.</P>
  <P>
   Therefore you should create call flow component such as a frame only 
   if your the frame contains alot of original information not existing 
   in another frame. For example, you would create a new frame only if 
   your frame requires alot of unique information not found on existing 
   frames. If this the case it is better to build a frame from scratch 
   by creating a new frame.</P>
  <P>
   Unless new tables are added, most attributes are already created.</P>
  <P>
   Creating call flow components has an important consequence because 
   you have to know what you are doing to have the call flow component 
   work properly in FNSNet. Creating call flow components is a complex 
   task requiring an understanding of FNSNet architecture as well as the 
   flow of data in FNSNet. Please consult a developer before creating 
   call flow components.</P>
