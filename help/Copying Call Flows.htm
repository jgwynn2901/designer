   Copying Call Flows</H1>
  <P>
   You can either share or copy call flows. Whether you want to share 
   call flows or copy call flows depends on how you want to use the call 
   flow. If you plan to use the call flow as is, you may want to use a <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">shared
    call flow</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A shared call flow is an 
   existing call flow in a database used in other call flows.)</DFN>. If 
   you plan on making changes to the call flow, you may want to use a <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">copied
    call flow</CITE> </SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed">(A copied call flow is a 
   duplicate of a call flow in a database. It is not shared by other 
   call flows.)</DFN>.</P>
  <P>
   Copying call flows allows you greater flexibility because you are 
   using duplicates of call flows. This allows you to modify the copy of 
   the call flow to suit your needs.</P>
  <P>
   Therefore you should copy a call flow if you know of another call 
   flow that has most of the same informational requirements. For 
   example, if you need a Worker's Compensation call flow for AIG you 
   might want to copy the Gallagher Bassett Worker's Compensation call 
   flow and change it to exactly meet your informational needs.</P>
  <P>
   You do this by copying the call flow to the clipboard and pasting the 
   call flow from the clipboard to its new location. You can change the 
   call flow by editing it.</P>
