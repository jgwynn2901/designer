  <P>
   The call representative uses call flows to obtain claim information 
   from the caller. The <SPAN ONCLICK="javascript:outline2()"><CITE CLASS="expandspot">call flow</CITE></SPAN><DFN CLASS="collapsed"> 
   (A call flow is a group of screens that collect or lookup data as the 
   call representative is taking the call.)</DFN> requests claim 
   information required to complete a particular type of call. It is 
   specific to a line of business. For example the &quot;Workers 
   Compensation&quot; call flow requests information required to 
   correctly file a &quot;Worker's Compensation Claim.&quot; The 
   &quot;Commercial Liability&quot; call flow requests information 
   required to correctly file a &quot;Commercial Liability&quot; claim.</P>
